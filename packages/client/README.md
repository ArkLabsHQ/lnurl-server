# @arkade-os/lnurl-client

Full-duplex client for the lnurl-server protocol: payer (`resolve`, `requestInvoice`, `pollVerify`) and receiver (sessions, settled reporting, address and Arkade-identity registration).

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @arkade-os/lnurl-client
```

Runtime dependencies are `@scure/base` and `@noble/hashes` - nothing else is pulled in, and the package never imports the server, so app bundles stay free of `express` and `sqlite`.

## Payer

`createLnurlClient()` with no `baseUrl` covers payer-only use: `resolve`, `requestInvoice` and `pollVerify` talk to whatever host the address or LNURL points at.

```ts
import { createLnurlClient } from "@arkade-os/lnurl-client";

const payer = createLnurlClient();

const payRequest = await payer.resolve("alice@example.com"); // or an lnurl bech32 string
const invoice = await payer.requestInvoice(payRequest, { amountSat: 50 });

// Pay invoice.pr through your own Lightning path, then wait for settlement:
if (invoice.kind === "bolt11" && invoice.verify) {
  const status = await payer.pollVerify(invoice.verify, { timeoutMs: 120_000, intervalMs: 1_000 });
  if (status.kind === "bolt11" && status.settled) {
    console.log("settled, preimage:", status.preimage);
  }
}
```

`requestInvoice` takes `amountSat` plus an optional `comment`. On an address payRequest it also accepts `paymentOption` and `unit`; on a session payRequest those two are rejected. The amount is range-checked locally against `minSendable`/`maxSendable` before anything hits the wire.

## Receiver

Receiver and management calls need `baseUrl`. `deriveSessionToken` turns a wallet private key (hex) into a stable session token; opening a session with the same token reconnects the same session id.

```ts
import { createLnurlClient, deriveSessionToken } from "@arkade-os/lnurl-client";

const receiver = createLnurlClient({ baseUrl: "https://lnurl.example.com" });
const token = deriveSessionToken("<wallet-private-key-hex>");

const session = await receiver.openSession({ token }, {
  onInvoiceRequest: async ({ amountMsat }, respond) => {
    const pr = await makeInvoice(amountMsat); // injected invoice provider: your Lightning node
    await respond.answerInvoice(pr);           // or: await respond.rejectInvoice(reason)
  },
});

// session.lnurl is what payers resolve. Once your node reports the invoice settled:
await session.reportSettled("<preimage-hex>");
session.close();
```

`deriveSessionToken` is byte-compatible with the wallet's existing derivation on purpose: the token derives the session id, which is the ownership key for registered lightning addresses, so changing it would orphan addresses users already hold.

## Errors

Two shapes, both surfaced as `LnurlError`:

- LUD-06 endpoints answer HTTP 200 carrying `{ status: "ERROR", reason }`.
- Management endpoints answer a real status code carrying `{ error, code? }` (for example 409 with `USERNAME_TAKEN`).
- Rate limits mix the two: HTTP 429 with the `{ status: "ERROR" }` body.

`LnurlError` carries `reason`, optional `httpStatus` and `code`, and `retryable`, which is true if and only if `httpStatus === 429`. Everything else is terminal - do not retry it into a different answer.

`LnurlTransportError` means the request or the stream itself failed (network down, unreadable SSE body). `LnurlTimeoutError` means `pollVerify` ran past `timeoutMs`; its `lastSnapshot` holds the last verify status seen.

## Transport

The receiver session is POST-SSE over `fetch`: `openSession` POSTs a JSON body to `/lnurl/session` and reads the event stream from `response.body`. It is not `EventSource` - `EventSource` is GET-only and cannot send the JSON body or the `Authorization` header this protocol needs. A runtime whose `fetch` does not give a readable `response.body` is unsupported: `openSession` fails loudly instead of hanging.
